##Learning about Preprocessors in C Language Programming

###The Process of compilation of C programs is divided into four(4) processes namely
(1)	Prepocessor:	includes header files into the source code, removes comments in the C program & replaces macro_name with code.

(2)	Compiler:	generates assembly code

(3)	Assembler:	converts assembly code to machine language(object files)

(5)	Linker:		Links object file to libraries.
